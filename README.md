# 6.VERIFICATION-OF-MAXIMUM-POWER-TRANSFER-THEOREM

**AIM:**

To measure the power absorbed in a load and to verify that the power absorbed in a load is maximum only when load resistance is equal to the source resistance.

**APPARATUS REQUIRED:**

Voltmeter (0-15V) MC

Ammeter (0-500mA) MC

Resistors 560 Ω - 2, 470 Ω -1

RPS(DC Supply)  15V	

**THEORY:**

The maximum power transfer theorem states that “A load will receive maximum power from a linear bilateral DC network when its total resistive value is exactly equal to the Thevenin resistance of the network as seen by load”.

For the network in figure (a), maximum power will be delivered to the load when RL=RTh.

In a simpler form the circuit may contain a voltage source VS having internal resistance RS and connected across a load RL. To find power.
 
The maximum power transfer theorem tells us that the load should be equal in magnitude to the source resistance for maximum power to be absorbed by the load.

**PROCEDURE:**

1.	Make connection as per the circuit diagram.

2.	Change the resistors RL whose value close to Rth, measure the corresponding VL, IL and calculate the power PL and enter into the table (2).

3.	Plot a graph between RL and PL and find the RL corresponding to maximum power transfer.

4.	Verify the measured values of RL at maximum power transfer as same as calculated and found graphically.

**RESULT:**

Thus maximum power transfer theorem is verified practically and theoretically
